# Project Setup and Start Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

## Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the application's directory.
2. Run the command `npm install` in the console (this will install the project's dependencies).
3. Rename the `.env-example` file to `.env`.
4. Paste the API key obtained from OpenWeather into the `your_api_key` field in the `.env` file.
5. Start the application with the command `npm run dev` (once the application is up and running, open it in a browser like Opera or Chrome).
